# Multi-Class-Image-Classification-using-YOLOv5
This project implements a Multi-Class Image Classification model using YOLOv5, a state-of-the-art deep learning architecture for object detection and classification. The model is trained to recognize multiple classes of objects in images, providing accurate classification and bounding box predictions. The
